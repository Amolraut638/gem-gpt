# ChatGPT Clone using Gemini API (Assistant-UI)

This is a simple AI-powered chat application built using [Assistant-UI](https://www.assistant-ui.com/docs/getting-started), integrated with **Google's Gemini API (gemini-pro)**. I followed the setup to learn how to use AI SDKs, manage environment variables, and deploy full-stack apps with **Next.js** and **Vercel**.

## Demo

üîó [Live Site](https://gem-gpt-one.vercel.app/)

## What I Learned

- Setting up a Next.js project using `npx assistant-ui@latest create`
- Installing and using the `@ai-sdk/google` for Gemini integration
- Creating API routes in Next.js (`route.ts`)
- Managing API keys securely via `.env.local`
- Running and building the project locally
- Deploying the project to **Vercel** via **GitHub**

---

## Tech Stack

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (via Assistant-UI)
- Vercel (Deployment)
- Google Gemini API
- AI SDK (`@ai-sdk/google`, `@assistant-ui/react-ai-sdk`, `ai`)
